What better way to learn Go (and a lot of programming in general) than by creating a maze solver?

## Goals

- Solve any 2D maze text file you throw at it
- Handle backtracking
- Learn different algorithms to solve a maze
- Compare different algorithms
- Learn and implement test suites (unit testing/TDD)
- Generate its own mazes
- Async/goroutines

## Status

- 2022-02-14 Can follow a linear path.

## How to use

It should be noted that I am not sure if this is the right away to go about this...

1. Install [go](https://go.dev)
2. Clone this repo
3. Open a terminal in the root of this project
4. `go run .`
